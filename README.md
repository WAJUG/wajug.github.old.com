#### Instruction to run the code...
Since no server is involve up to now, the easiest way to workaround the problem with AJAX access of local files is to start an HTTP server on the site folder.

A lightweight server is available in any python installation, so navigate to the source folder in a terminal and launch `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
